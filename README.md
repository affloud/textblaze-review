## TextBlaze Features

TextBlaze offers a suite of features to streamline typing and automate workflows. Below are the key functionalities, each designed to save time and improve consistency.

### Snippets
Snippets are customizable text shortcuts that users can insert anywhere using keyboard commands (e.g., "/ty" for a thank-you note). They support plain text, images, and rich formatting, reducing manual typing. Snippets are organized into folders for easy access and can be shared with teams, ensuring consistent messaging across departments.

### Dynamic Commands
Dynamic commands add flexibility to snippets by inserting real-time data, such as today’s date, recipient names, or calculated values. Users can create placeholders, perform basic math, or use conditional logic (if/then statements) to personalize messages. This feature is ideal for crafting tailored emails or proposals at scale.

### Templates
TextBlaze’s templates are pre-built or customizable frameworks for emails, blog posts, or reports. They include placeholders for dynamic fields like names or dates, allowing users to generate professional content quickly. Templates are especially useful for sales pitches or customer support responses.

### Integrations
TextBlaze integrates with platforms like Gmail, LinkedIn, Google Docs, Salesforce, and OpenAI. Users can pull data from webpages or apps into snippets, automate workflows, or trigger actions like updating ticketing systems. These integrations make TextBlaze a versatile tool for multi-platform workflows.

### Team Collaboration
Collaboration features allow teams to share snippets, assign roles (viewer, editor, owner), and track usage analytics. Editors can set default folders for new members, ensuring consistent communication. This is perfect for onboarding and maintaining brand voice across teams.

### Autopilot
Autopilot automates repetitive tasks beyond typing, such as simulating keyboard presses or clicking webpage elements. Users can automate form submissions or navigate sections, saving time on routine processes like data entry or email follow-ups.

### Security
TextBlaze prioritizes data security with SOC 2 compliance, scalable architecture, and backups. It avoids collecting sensitive data and supports single sign-on (SSO) for enterprise users, making it a trusted choice for businesses handling confidential information.
